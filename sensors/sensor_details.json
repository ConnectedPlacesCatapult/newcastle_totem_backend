Amplitude measures how forceful the wave is. It is measured in decibels or dBA of sound pressure. 0 dBA is the softest level that a person can hear. Normal speaking voices are around 65 dBA. A rock concert can be about 120 dBA.\n\nSounds that are 85 dBA or above can permanently damage your ears. The more sound pressure a sound has, the less time it takes to cause damage. For example, a sound at 85 dBA may take as long at 8 hours to cause permanent damage, while a sound at 100 dBA can start damaging hair cells after only 30 minutes of listening.", "key": "sound", "label": "Noise level"}, "CO": {"taglines": ["Aristotle (384\u2013322 BC) first recorded that burning coals produced <em>toxic fumes</em>", "Outside of Earth, carbon monoxide is the <em>second-most common molecule</em> in the interstellar medium, after molecular hydrogen.
